	user event : user trigger to ctrl the device.
				these events may come from phone msg/IR key/Panel key,
			 	key event include key up/key down/long press/key combination.

			 	These is a kind of event which can directly map to user cmd, which we named "Directly cmd".
			 	This can be defined just the same as phone's cmd, and easy used for cli debugging.

	user cmd : map user event to certain single ctrl cmd which the device can response directly, like pause playback, start bt pairing.

	example : customer may define long press mute key as BT key.
			  event will be : mute_down.mute_press.....mute_up
			  this event will be map to user cmd : E_USERCMD_TYPE_BT_CTRL.E_BT_CTRL_TYPE_PAIR.
